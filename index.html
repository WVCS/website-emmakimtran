  <h3> <i> What is AP CSP?
    <br>
    AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical.

    Why did I take AP CSP?
    I wanted to take AP CSP to learn about coding and why computers work the way the work. Wanting to further my knowledge about science, I wanted to take an AP science class as well to prepare me for college. I want to major in Technology and Information Systems which requires me to take Computer Programming classes, so taking this class in advance really helps.
